	* c/holidays.c:
	Allow Asara B'Tevet to fall on a Friday. According to
	http://www.ou.org/chagim/roshchodesh/tevet/fast.htm

	 "If a public fast [e.g. Asara B'Tevet] occurs on Erev Shabbat, we
	fast the entire day till the conclusion of the fast, even though
	it means entering Shabbat while fasting."

	If it falls on Shabbat, it still gets moved to Sunday.
