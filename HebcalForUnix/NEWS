 In 2005 the 109th Congress enacted P.L. 109-58, the Energy Policy Act
 of 2005.  Section 110 of this Act amends the Uniform Time Act,
 changing the beginning of DST to the second Sunday in March and the
 ending of DST to the first Sunday in November.  This change will take
 effect in March of 2007. The Act requires the Secretary of Commerce to
 report to Congress within nine months of this date on the impact of
 this section on energy consumption in the United States. Congress
 retains the right to revert the Daylight Saving Time back to the 2005
 time schedules once the Department study is complete.

  In years where 15 Adar falls on Saturday, the observances of Shushan purim are 
  distributed over Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  This is not represented, and Shushan
  Purim is indicated as falling on Sunday.  The megilah is read on Friday 
  in Jerusalem.
