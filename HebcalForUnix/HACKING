To build hebcal from the source repository, you'll need a few more
tools than are needed in order to build from distributions.   In
particular, you'll need 

GNU autoconf version 2.59
GNU automake version 1.9.5  or later
GNU m4 version 1.4.3 or later
GNU make v3.79 or later
Perl v5.0 or later

If you have any questions, concerns or feedback, please feel free to
post them in the hebcal project trackers at http://hebcal.sf.net/ or 
contact Danny Sadinoff directly at hebcal@sadinoff.com
